## Description:
For this homework assignment, I was tasked with creating my portfolio with React. I kept my profile simple with a dark grey and light grey theme. I created the header and the footer components so that they both can be static on the page. In the header, I have links to my home page which is the "about me" section, a page for a few of my projects and a link to download my resume. Both the homepage and my projects page will render when clicked. 

* The following link will be for my deployed react portfolio:
  * https://vickphat.github.io/react-portfolio/
